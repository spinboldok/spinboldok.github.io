title: A slow start to the week, but...
---

As the title suggests, the week began on a rather dull note with a little bit of procrastination of the required readings. However, I caught up well towards the end of the week and made some progress. Among the new learning this week:

* Markdown syntax
* More Effective C++ - specifically, the `SmartPtr` implementation

>> I think it would be good learning exercise to compare the `SmartPtr` examples from *Modern C++* book and *More EC++*. *C++11* has `shared_ptr` and other abstractions that appear even more interesting, and will hopefully constitute a good blog post in the future.

* Dynamic programming

>> I got my hands on the third edition of *Introduction to Algorithms* book. I also found a rather recent series of lectures for this book on Youtube(circa 2011), so I think there's plenty of learning for me in this area still ahead.


What's up for next week? More learning, ofcourse! I want to:

* Brush up and start working with `Java Swing` framework to gain more experience building UI.
* I wish to take up a programming language with a different paradigm - *Erlang* comes to mind. I had abandoned learning *Erlang* sometime in 2010, but my interest has since renewed. I hope to get started on this next week.
* More C++ learning - this will probably be a bullet point on every week's agenda :)
* Dynamic programming - gotta get started with solving problems from *TopCoder*.
* If time permits, I'd like to sneak in some *JavaScript* and *Ruby* too.

Until later then!
