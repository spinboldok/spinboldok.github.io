title: My first blogpost
---

I am excited to finally have my own blog. GitHub Pages and Jekyll really deserve a shoutout for helping me get my blog up and running in a manner of minutes. I think I will have fun exploring Jekyll's markdown syntax as I write blog posts. 

My next steps are to get moving quickly with learning more markdown syntax. Of special interest to me are the syntax for markdown(I still don't know enough to pick between Markdown and Textile. I think I will use the default template for a blog at present, and change the theme a little further down the line. I need to learn how to embed code(looks easy), and pictures(unsure about this involves). I need a method for tagging posts, and finally, the blog needs to use a comment engine like Facebook or Disqus.

Until later!
